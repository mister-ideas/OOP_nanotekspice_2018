Hidden behind assembly and machine languages is the hardware itself. Hardware is built from digital electronic components: chipsets. Chipsets are tiny little functions with input and outputs that can be linked together to create more powerfull functions, just like in software. These functions are exclusively based on boolean logic, meaning the only inputs and outputs are true and false. NanoTekSpiceis a logic simulator that builds a graph (the nodes of which will be simulated digital electronic components, inputs or outputs) from a configuration file, and injects values into that graph to get results.

# Building

# Usage
$ ./nanotekspice [file_path] (input_name=input_value)
